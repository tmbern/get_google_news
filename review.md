Very clean! Looks awesome! 

I really liked how detailed you were in the description on the PyPI site. Especially liked the examples that you put and the use of the "template" example that you put on there. Made it very intuitive for someone with no prior knowledge of the function to use. 

The format of the code was very readable as well. very cleanly written.

Only thing I could think of that could be more helpful would be to add a description for the get() function. I dont have any experience with beautiful soup so its more of a curiousity thing for me. Would be helpful to see described what that function does. 

Awesome job man!
